# ZeoTap-DS-Assignment


**Overview**
This project aims to perform customer clustering analysis on transactional data from an e-commerce platform. Using K-Means clustering, the project groups customers based on features such as quantity, total value, and price of items they have purchased. The output includes detailed cluster characteristics, a visual representation of the clusters, and a PDF report summarizing the clustering results.

**Final Results**

Clusters = 9

Davies-Bouldin Index: 0.8479

**Clustering Summary**:

Cluster 1 --->
Size : 12

Cluster 2 --->
Size : 26

Cluster 3 --->
Size : 14

Cluster 4 --->
Size : 10

Cluster 5 --->
Size : 5

Cluster 6 --->
Size : 16

Cluster 7 --->
Size : 39

Cluster 8 --->
Size : 33

Cluster 9 --->
Size : 5


**Future Improvements**
Optimal Number of Clusters: Use techniques like the Elbow Method or Silhouette Score to determine the optimal number of clusters.
Incorporate More Features: Additional customer features such as demographic data (age, region) could be integrated for better clustering.
Clustering Algorithms: Explore other clustering algorithms like DBSCAN or Hierarchical Clustering to compare the results.
