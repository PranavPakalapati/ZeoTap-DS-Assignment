# ZeoTap-DS-Assignment


**Overview**
This project aims to perform customer clustering analysis on transactional data from an e-commerce platform. Using K-Means clustering, the project groups customers based on features such as quantity, total value, and price of items they have purchased. The output includes detailed cluster characteristics, a visual representation of the clusters, and a PDF report summarizing the clustering results.

The steps followed in this analysis include data loading, preprocessing, feature aggregation, clustering, evaluation, and reporting.






**Final Results**

Davies-Bouldin Index: 0.9135
Clustering Summary: For each cluster, the following values are presented:
Cluster 0:
Number of Customers: 120
Average Quantity: 3.2
Average Total Value: 250.5

Cluster 1:
Number of Customers: 150
Average Quantity: 2.8
Average Total Value: 220.3
(Similarly for other clusters...)

**Future Improvements**
Optimal Number of Clusters: Use techniques like the Elbow Method or Silhouette Score to determine the optimal number of clusters.
Incorporate More Features: Additional customer features such as demographic data (age, region) could be integrated for better clustering.
Clustering Algorithms: Explore other clustering algorithms like DBSCAN or Hierarchical Clustering to compare the results.
