# ZeoTap-DS-Assignment


**Overview**
This project aims to perform customer clustering analysis on transactional data from an e-commerce platform. Using K-Means clustering, the project groups customers based on features such as quantity, total value, and price of items they have purchased. The output includes detailed cluster characteristics, a visual representation of the clusters, and a PDF report summarizing the clustering results.

**Final Results**

Clusters = 9

Davies-Bouldin Index: 0.8479

**Clustering Summary**:

Cluster 1:
Size : 

Cluster 2:
Size : 

Cluster 3:

Cluster 5:
Size : 

Cluster 6:
Size : 

Cluster 7:
Size : 

Cluster 8:
Size : 


**Future Improvements**
Optimal Number of Clusters: Use techniques like the Elbow Method or Silhouette Score to determine the optimal number of clusters.
Incorporate More Features: Additional customer features such as demographic data (age, region) could be integrated for better clustering.
Clustering Algorithms: Explore other clustering algorithms like DBSCAN or Hierarchical Clustering to compare the results.
